# Hello-World
An introduction to Jacwilalasey

Hi all, 
I am starting a new journey in learning computer sciences with a focus on programming as means to combine my current experience in organisation design, process improvement and programme management to bridge the gap between what I do now and having a more tech focus. The major aim is to be able to switch my career focus to more development heavy, while leaning on existing skills over the next 12 months. 

Let's see how it goes!
